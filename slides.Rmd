## Introduction

  - Who is this tutorial aimed at?
  - What will this tutorial cover?
  - What is Shiny?
  - Why use Shiny?
  - How do we use Shiny (with examples)
  
## What is Shiny

  - Webapp framework built in R
  - Show examples of websites:
    - COZI
    - Genetic subtype predictor
    - Multi-state model
    - A more professional option!
    
## Why use Shiny?

  - Want a website and already comfortable with R!
  - Don't have to use \alert{any} Javascript, HTML, CSS, or consider web hosting 
  - Very easy to get website up and running quickly with minimal boilerplate
  - Can host on University infrastructure `shiny.york.ac.uk`
  - However, if want to design a more professional looking website will need to use Javascript & CSS, at which point Shiny doesn't shine...
 
## What sorts of websites can I create with it?

  - Text, plots and tables using the exact same syntax
  - \alert{Interactive widgets}:
    - Plots with controls
    - User input: sliders, buttons, checkboxs
    - Maps
    - Animations
    - Upload files
  - All of this just with using R only, with Javascript can do a lot more
  
## Uses

  - Have a place to visualise live data online
  - Provide tools to accompany published models, i.e. showing how model works and allow users to run their own data through it
  - Exploring large datasets interactively
  - Sharing work with project collaborators to save them asking lots of questions
  - If need some widgets, like Maps
  
## What does code look like?

  - Go through examples from:
    - Static page. Just plot, text, table. Show code layout and how server and UI link together
    - Interactivity: Use plotly and DT on the same outputs
    - User controls: Add in slider, text box etc... Discuss reactivity
    - Dashboard / UI: How to make app look better
    - Extending with JS/CSS: Worth including or just mention it's possible?
    
## Hosting: 

  - Shinyapps.io
  - shiny.york.ac.uk

## Conclusions

  - Shown how easy Shiny is to use
  - Compare code structure to JS apps showing how can get hard to follow for bigger projects?
